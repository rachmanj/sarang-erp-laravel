# Enhanced Project Documentation Automation

## Core Documentation Maintenance

After every significant code change, you MUST update the relevant documentation:

### Architecture Changes

When modifying system structure, components, or data flow:

1. Update `docs/architecture.md` with current state
2. Add/update Mermaid diagrams if data flow changed
3. Log architectural decisions in `docs/decisions.md`
4. Note any important discoveries in `MEMORY.md`

### Feature Development

When working on tasks:

1. Update progress in `docs/todo.md`
2. Move completed items to the "Recently Completed" section
3. Update `docs/backlog.md` if scope or priorities change
4. Document any technical decisions made

### Bug Fixes & Issues

When resolving problems:

1. Log the issue and solution in `MEMORY.md`
2. Update task status in `docs/todo.md`
3. Update architecture docs if the fix reveals structural changes

### Regular Maintenance

Periodically (when todo.md gets cluttered):

1. Archive old completed items from `docs/todo.md`
2. Move future ideas from todo to `docs/backlog.md`
3. Reprioritize based on what you've learned

## Database Access Preferences

### MySQL MCP Integration

-   **ALWAYS use MySQL MCP** for database queries instead of Laravel Tinker commands
-   MCP provides direct, safe, read-only access to the `sarang_live` database
-   Query the database directly using natural language requests

### Database Query Guidelines

-   Use direct SQL queries via MCP for data exploration and analysis
-   Prefer MCP queries over `php artisan tinker` commands for database inspection
-   Examples:
    -   Instead of: "Run `User::count()` in tinker"
    -   Use: "How many users are in the database?"
    -   Instead of: "Check recent distributions with tinker"
    -   Use: "Show me distributions created in the last 7 days"

### When to Use Each Tool

-   **MySQL MCP**: Data inspection, analysis, counts, structure exploration
-   **Laravel Artisan**: Migrations, seeding, cache clearing, queue management
-   **Manual file editing**: Code changes, configuration updates

## Documentation Standards

### Architecture Documentation

-   Document CURRENT state, not intended state
-   Include working code examples and patterns
-   Generate Mermaid diagrams for complex data flows
-   Reference specific files and functions when relevant

### Task Management

-   Include sufficient context for future AI assistance
-   Reference specific files, functions, and error messages
-   Update status and completion dates accurately
-   Note blockers and dependencies clearly
-   Keep focus on immediate work, move future ideas to backlog

### Memory Entries

-   Focus on significant decisions and learnings
-   Include actionable insights, not just descriptions
-   Keep entries concise but informative
-   Archive old entries when file gets too long

### Decision Records

-   Capture context that led to the decision
-   Document alternatives that were considered
-   Include implementation implications
-   Set review dates for revisiting decisions

## Cross-Referencing Rules

-   Always check existing documentation before adding new content
-   Link related decisions, tasks, and architecture changes
-   Update multiple files when changes affect multiple areas
-   Maintain consistency between memory, architecture, and task tracking

since this app already launched, you need to consider existing data in db. live db already restore to this local db for you to access.
After making change, test it in the browser using chrome-devtools MCP, assume the server is already running

Remember: These documents should provide comprehensive context for future development and AI assistance, evolving as living documentation that stays current with your codebase.
