### [056] Critical Sales Invoice Accounting Logic Issue Identified (2025-09-22) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Sales Invoice posting fails with "Journal is not balanced" error. The accounting logic creates unbalanced journal entries by crediting both revenue account AND accounts receivable account.

**Solution**: Identified root cause in SalesInvoiceController post method. The system creates journal entries: Debit AR UnInvoice (500,000 + VAT), Credit Revenue Account (500,000), Credit AR Account (500,000 + VAT).

**Key Learning**: Successfully implemented enterprise-level approval management system providing sophisticated role-based routing, configurable amount-based thresholds, multi-level workflow support, and centralized approval queue management. Implementation demonstrates excellent separation of concerns with dedicated service architecture, comprehensive database design with proper relationships, sophisticated business logic with automatic workflow completion, professional user interface with SweetAlert2 confirmations, and seamless integration with existing ERP architecture. System now provides complete approval management capabilities with role-based assignment (Officer/Supervisor/Manager), amount-based routing (0-5M: Officer, 5M-15M: Officer+Supervisor, 15M+: Officer+Supervisor+Manager), centralized dashboard with statistics and pending approvals, and comprehensive workflow management enabling efficient document approval processes for trading company operations.

### [061] Enhanced Approval Dashboard with Detailed PO Information (2025-09-23) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Provide approvers with comprehensive Purchase Order details to enable informed decision-making, including vendor information, line items, quantities, prices, and business context for better approval decisions.

**Solution**: Enhanced approval dashboard with expandable rows showing detailed PO information including vendor/warehouse details, complete line items table with item codes/names/descriptions/quantities/prices, professional card-based layout with proper formatting, enhanced controller with eager loading of related models (businessPartner, warehouse, lines), and vanilla JavaScript implementation for expandable functionality avoiding jQuery dependency issues. Implemented comprehensive PO details display with basic information table, description section, and detailed line items table with proper currency formatting and item code highlighting.

**Key Learning**: Approvers need complete visibility into what they're approving to make informed decisions. Expandable UI patterns with detailed information tables significantly improve decision-making quality while maintaining clean interface design. Enhanced approval dashboard now provides comprehensive PO visibility including vendor information, complete line items with quantities and prices, warehouse details, and business context enabling approvers to understand the full scope and impact of their approval decisions.

### [062] ERP Module Mapping and Training Materials Drafting (2025-11-10) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Analyze codebase to map modules/features and draft comprehensive training materials with presentation prep.
**Solution**: Mapped 9 modules from architecture docs/code; built on existing training files, drafted 4 new modules via edits.
**Key Learning**: System has strong integrations for trading workflows; training emphasizes story-based learning for adoption.

### [063] Legacy Role Collision & Inventory Currency Alignment (2025-11-11) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Fresh migrations failed because Spatie's HasRoles trait collided with a custom `roles()` relation and the multi-currency seeder referenced missing inventory currency columns.
**Solution**: Renamed user legacy role relation/helpers to avoid overriding HasRoles attach flow and updated the inventory currency migration to create `purchase_currency_id`/`selling_currency_id` plus reran `migrate:fresh --seed`.
**Key Learning**: Avoid redefining framework-provided relations when using traits like HasRoles, and keep model fillables, migrations, and seeders aligned on column names to prevent silent runtime warnings.

### [064] Dashboard Data Readiness Assessment (2025-11-11) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Validate whether the current environment contains enough operational history to support the redesigned executive dashboard KPIs.
**Solution**: Ran MCP MySQL counts across core tables (`sales_invoices`, `purchase_invoices`, `inventory_items`, `journals`, `business_partners`, `approval_workflows`, `assets`) and recorded findings plus seeding requirements in `docs/dashboard-phase1-discovery.md`.
**Key Learning**: The workspace database is empty, so dashboard development must include a seeded or replicated dataset before implementing KPI widgets and performance testing; prioritize data fixture creation ahead of Phase 2.

### [065] Dashboard Phase 1 Metric Inventory & Payload Plan (2025-11-11) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Define exactly which metrics the upgraded dashboard must serve and how to deliver them without view-level queries or stakeholder interviews.
**Solution**: Documented full metric inventory, mapped data sources and reusable services, and drafted a unified `DashboardDataService` payload contract with caching guidance in `docs/dashboard-phase1-discovery.md`.
**Key Learning**: Centralising dashboard data through a single service and cached JSON payload will keep the view slim, respect permissions, and let us compose widgets quickly once seed data arrives; future work focuses on implementing that service and front-end refactor.

### [066] Sales Dashboard Implementation with AR Invoice Aging (2025-11-11) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Implement comprehensive Sales Dashboard with AR invoice aging analysis to match Purchase Dashboard functionality and provide sales managers with actionable insights into accounts receivable.
**Solution**: Created `SalesDashboardDataService` with AR aging calculations (Current, 1-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+ days), sales KPIs (Sales MTD, Outstanding AR, Pending Approvals, Open Sales Orders), sales order statistics, sales invoice statistics, delivery order statistics, top customers by outstanding AR, and recent invoices visualization. Implemented `SalesDashboardController` with refresh parameter support, created comprehensive AdminLTE dashboard view with visual progress bars, added route in `routes/web/orders.php`, updated sidebar link, and created comprehensive review document in `docs/sales-dashboard-review.md`.
**Key Learning**: Following the Purchase Dashboard pattern ensures consistency and reduces development time. AR aging calculation requires joining `sales_invoices` with `sales_receipt_allocations` to calculate outstanding amounts accurately. Visual progress bars for aging buckets provide immediate insight into payment collection status. Caching with 300s TTL improves performance while refresh parameter allows real-time data access when needed. Dashboard implementation completes the sales analytics infrastructure and provides sales managers with comprehensive AR management capabilities.

### [067] Dashboard Supplier Performance Table Guard (2025-11-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: `/dashboard` hard-failed with `SQLSTATE[42S02]` because the `supplier_performances` table was missing in the current `sarang_live` database, breaking the global executive dashboard.
**Solution**: Updated `DashboardDataService::buildSalesAndProcurementSnapshot()` to check `Schema::hasTable('supplier_performances')` before querying, returning an empty "Top Suppliers" list when the analytics table is absent so the dashboard still renders.
**Key Learning**: Cross-environment robustness on analytics widgets is critical—dashboard services should gracefully handle optional/advanced tables being absent instead of throwing, especially when schemas can lag behind features across deployments.
